# Data-Analysis
Worked through a classification predictive modeling machine learning problem from end-to-end using Python. Specifically, the steps covered were:
1. Problem Definition (Breast Cancer data).
2. Loading the Dataset.
3. Analyze Data (same scale but diâ†µerent distributions of data).
    * Evaluate Algorithms (KNN looked good).
    * Evaluate Algorithms with Standardization (KNN and SVM looked good).
4. Algorithm Tuning (K=19 for KNN was good, SVM with an RBF kernel and C=100 was best).. 
5. Finalize Model (use all training data and confirm using validation dataset)
